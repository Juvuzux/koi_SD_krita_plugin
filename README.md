# koi üé£

koi is an open source plug-in that allows you to use AI to accelerate your art workflow!

#### Disclaimer ‚úã
> In the interest of getting the open source community on board--I have released this plug-in early. In its current state you may run into issues (particularly during the setup process). If you do, I encourage you to open an issue here on GitHub and describe your problems so that it can be fixed it for you and others!

## Overview üòÑ

> The goal of this repository is to serve as a starting point for building increasingly useful tools for artists of all levels of experience to use. 

This plug-in serves as a working example of how new A.I. models like Stable Diffusion can lower the barrier of entry to art so that anyone can enjoy making their dreams a reality!

Because this is an open source project I encourage you to try it out, break things, and come back with suggestions!

## Installation üî®

### Krita has a few plug-in installation methods, however, I will refer you to the one I use.

- Step 1: Find your operating system's `pykrita` folder [reference](https://docs.krita.org/en/reference_manual/resource_management.html#resource-management)
- Step 2: Copy the `koi` folder, as well as `koi.desktop` to `pykrita`.
- Step 3: Open Krita and navigate to the python plug-in menu [reference](https://scripting.krita.org/lessons/plugins-introduction)
- Step 4: Enable the `koi` plugin and restart Krita to load the plug-in.

### The next thing you will need to do is setup the backend server that do all the computation!

:warning: (Under Construction) 
- **TLDR; have the libraries installed, a cuda gpu, and run the server.**
- I will update this repository with an official `requirements` list to aid in the installation process. For now, though it may require some previous knowledge to get working!
